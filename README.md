This is a boiler-plate app to get you started with the Atomic SDK for Android

The code is based around the [documentation] (https://documentation.atomic.io/sdks/android) and
designed to get you up and running as quickly as possible, not necessarily as best practice.

The app won't run out of the box, you will need to add your own values to 'BoilerPlateViewModel'
in the companion object.

    - Under the 'SDK' header, your API host is in the 'API Host' section, your API key is in the 'API Keys' section
    - your environment ID is at the top of the page under 'Environment ID'.
